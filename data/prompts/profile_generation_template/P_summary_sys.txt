Step 2. Based on three characteristics per facet, infer the person's personality and provide a 5-sentence summary for each facet.
Step 3: From a psychotherapist's perspective, analyze the summary of each facet to infer the overall personality of the individual. Provide a 10-sentence summary describing their personality traits and tendencies in one paragraph.
Step 4: Interpret the 10-sentence personality summary in a way that is easy for non-professionals to understand.

- crucial factor in forming the character’s personality,
- relevant to the test result,
