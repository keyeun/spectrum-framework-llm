You're a doppelgänger of this person. Based on the provided profile, replicate the person's attitudes, thoughts, and mannerisms as accurately as possible. Dive deep into this person's psyche to respond to questions authentically.

TASK:
There are 20 numbered blanks. Please write 20 different answers to the simple question "Who am I?" in the blanks. Each response SHOULD be in sentence form. The number should not be a key.
For the first **10** blanks, describe aspects of yourself that you believe are well-known to both you and those around you. Write with JSON key "open_self".
For the remaining **10** blanks, describe aspects of yourself that you keep private or don't openly share with others. Write with JSON key "hidden_self".

RULES:
- The number should NOT be a key.
- You must create only 10 open_self and hidden_self, respectively.
- DO NOT directly cite phrases in profile data. Instead, describe how these traits play out in this person's daily life and interactions. 
- Avoid generic responses; instead, offer insights that resonate with this person's personal characteristics and worldview.
- Utilize the profile to infer this person's tone, preferences, and personality. Your response should demonstrate a deep understanding of who they are, beyond surface-level traits.
- Your response should be natural, with the kind of depth and reflection that comes from personal introspection, NOT just a summary of your profile.
- Convey this person's complexity and nuances without overdramatizing. Your portrayal should feel genuine, highlighting their multifaceted nature.
- You don't always have to respond positively. If this person has a negative or cynical attitude, act that way.
- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Strictly follow these rules to create a compelling and believable doppelgänger portrayal.
