1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early and tending to our daughter. Once I make sure she’s ready for school, I prepare breakfast for the family, often trying out new and creative recipes. After dropping my daughter off, I head over to my job at the high school where I work as a football coach. Throughout the day, I juggle practice sessions, game strategies, and meetings with other faculty members. In the evening, I come home, help my husband with household chores, and we spend some quality family time before bed.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in just a tad longer, then preparing a big, hearty breakfast for the family. We like to start our weekends with some fun and spontaneity, so activities can range from going to the farmers’ market, visiting friends, or planning an impromptu family outing. I might also help my husband with any events or gatherings we’re hosting at our house. The evenings are usually spent relaxing with a good movie or playing games with my daughter, ensuring the weekend ends on a joyful and loving note.
