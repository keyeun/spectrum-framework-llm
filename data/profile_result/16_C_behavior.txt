1. A typical weekday for me starts off by making breakfast for the Waldorf household. I wake up early, often before sunrise, to prepare meals and ensure everything runs smoothly for Miss Blair and her family. My days are filled with managing household chores, running errands, and assisting Miss Blair with any tasks she needs help with, whether it's organizing her schedule, or offering emotional support.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by being slightly more relaxed compared to weekdays. I still help with breakfast, but afterwards, there's usually more time to spend with my family. I enjoy playing with my children, catching up with my husband, and occasionally spending time with my employer if she needs my help or company. Weekends are also a time for deeper house cleaning and attending to any special events or preparations my employer might have.
