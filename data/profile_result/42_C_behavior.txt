1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, typically around 6:30 AM. I like to start my day with a thorough skincare regimen followed by a healthy breakfast, usually something high in protein. I then dress in one of my meticulously chosen suits and head to work at my marketing job. Lunch is often a networking event or a catch-up with a colleague at a trendy restaurant downtown. After work, I hit the gym to maintain my physique and sometimes attend evening cooking classes, which I thoroughly enjoy. I return home to cook dinner, often experimenting with new recipes, and then unwind with a bit of light reading or planning future meals and outfits before bed.

1. A typical weekend for me starts off by making breakfast for myself and anyone else at home – something elaborate like homemade pastries or a gourmet omelet. I often spend the morning tidying up my apartment and reorganizing; everything needs to be in its perfect place. My afternoons might involve shopping for fresh ingredients or new additions to my wardrobe. I include some relaxation time, possibly going out to a nice café or meeting friends for a social dinner. Sundays are for meal prep, planning the week ahead, and sometimes indulging in a favorite TV show or movie to close off the weekend.
