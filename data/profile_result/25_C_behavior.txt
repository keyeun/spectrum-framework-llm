1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to help get my kids ready for school. After breakfast with my wife and the kids, I head off to work; currently, I'm serving as a judge in New York. My workday is filled with hearing cases, making rulings, and ensuring justice is served. Evenings are spent with family, often with dinners together, helping the kids with their homework, and relaxing with my wife by watching TV or catching up on our day. We usually end the night by reading bedtime stories to the kids before getting some rest.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little longer than weekdays. After a hearty breakfast with the family, we often go on fun outings like trips to the zoo, the park, or museums. If the weather is nice, we might have a barbecue or a picnic. Weekends are all about family time, so we also enjoy playing games, watching movies, or just hanging out at home. Sundays are usually reserved for some quiet time, perhaps preparing for the week ahead and catching up on any personal projects or hobbies I love, like cooking or making up fun games to play with the kids.
