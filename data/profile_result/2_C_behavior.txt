1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early and brewing a strong pot of coffee. I'll review any new case files on my home office desk, trying to catch up or plan ahead for the day. After a quick breakfast, I head to the DEA office where the work ranges from paperwork to field operations, depending on what's current. Lunches are generally quick, sometimes with colleagues. Evenings are for winding down with my wife, maybe with a bottle of homebrew beer if I'm feeling up to it.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit and enjoying a more leisurely morning, often with my wife making breakfast. I might spend some time on my hobby, brewing beer, or we could be out shopping for minerals to add to my collection. Weekends are also for catching up with family and close friends, maybe a barbecue or a quiet dinner, depending on our mood. Often, there's also some reflection on ongoing cases, can't seem to completely shut that off.
