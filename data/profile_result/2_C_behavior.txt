1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to head to my job as a pharmaceutical sales representative. I make sure to grab a quick breakfast and a coffee on the go. Work involves a lot of travel, meeting clients, and sometimes long hours, but I love it and the independence it brings. In the evenings, I usually come home and spend time with my husband, maybe watch some TV or hang out with friends at our apartment or the comic book store.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit longer than on weekdays, enjoying a leisurely morning at home with Leonard. We might have brunch or coffee together, and sometimes I'll meet up with friends for some girl time. Weekends are also about relaxing, maybe having a game night or watching movies with our group of friends. My husband and I like to keep it low-key but fun, cherishing the time we can spend together away from our busy work schedules.
