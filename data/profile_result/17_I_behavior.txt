1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up promptly at 6:45 am, followed by a well-structured morning routine that includes a meticulous personal grooming regimen and a precisely measured breakfast. I then take my designated spot on the couch to catch up on any scientific papers or articles I missed overnight before heading to work at Caltech, where I immerse myself in theoretical physics research and occasionally teach. My evenings are scheduled with activities like vintage video game nights, comic book store visits, or themed dinners with my friends, depending on the day of the week.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by adhering to my Saturday morning routine of watching "Doctor Who" while enjoying a bowl of cereal. Saturdays are highly structured to maximize leisure and personal projects, which may include model train building, experiments, or updates to my roommate agreement. Sundays begin with a brisk walk, followed by time spent on my personal research projects. Family video calls are a usual feature before preparing for the upcoming week.
