1. A typical weekday for me starts off by going for a quick jog or working out at the gym before heading back to my apartment for a shower. I then get ready for work, choosing my outfit carefully because first impressions matter in my job at Ralph Lauren. I usually grab a coffee and maybe catch up with friends if we have time. My days at the office are busy with meetings, designing, and planning new collections. After work, I might meet up with the gang at a cafe or head home to unwind, check my voicemail, and maybe catch a little TV before bed.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little since I don’t have to rush to the office. I often enjoy a leisurely breakfast, maybe brunch with friends. Weekends are my time to relax and do the things I love: shopping, hanging out with my daughter, or sometimes visiting my parents. I might also spend some time catching up on errands and chores or just lounging around and reading a good fashion magazine. In the evenings, it’s great to catch a movie, have dinner out, or spend quality time with friends.
