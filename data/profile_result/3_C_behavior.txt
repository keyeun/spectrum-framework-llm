1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to help get the kids ready for the day. I then head to the office or sometimes work from home, depending on the project. At work, my day is filled with engineering tasks, meetings, and collaborating with my colleagues at Caltech. In the evening, I make it a point to have dinner with my wife and the kids, followed by some family time before winding down with a bit of TV or video games.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little later than on weekdays, if the kids allow it. We often have family activities planned, like trips to the park or playing in the backyard. My wife and I also try to schedule some couple's time, like a date night or movie at home, once the kids are asleep. I also enjoy tinkering with my personal projects or catching up with friends, sometimes even online gaming sessions with my friends.
