1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting up early, usually around 6 AM. I begin my day with a quick breakfast, often something healthy like yogurt and fruit. Afterward, I catch up on any last-minute assignments or readings for my college classes. I head to the university, where I attend lectures and lab sessions. Between classes, I visit the library to continue my research or work on ongoing projects. Evenings are spent either attending study groups or tutoring fellow students, followed by returning home to relax and review the day's work before bed.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later, usually until around 8 AM, to catch up on rest. My weekends are a blend of relaxation and productivity. I often start with a run or a yoga session to stay active. After that, I might dedicate a few hours to reading ahead for my courses or working on extracurricular projects. Afternoons are for spending time with family or occasionally catching up with friends. I also enjoy watching documentaries or educational programs to unwind. Dinner is usually a family affair, allowing us to bond and discuss our week.
