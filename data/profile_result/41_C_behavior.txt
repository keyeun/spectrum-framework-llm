1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up way later than I'd like, but that's pretty much my thing. I roll out of bed, throw on some clothes, and make my way to the bar, which I own and manage. My mornings are spent restocking, cleaning, and making sure everything's in place for the day's customers. By afternoon, I'm usually working behind the bar, serving drinks and engaging in my favorite activity—people-watching. In the evenings, I relax with my friends at the loft, maybe watch some TV or just hang out with them until it's time to hit the sack.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by leisurely getting out of bed without the worry of running the bar during the day. Saturdays might involve some sort of breakfast at a local diner with the gang, then doing whatever random activity my friend has planned, whether it's a game night or some quirky adventure. Afternoons are often spent at the bar, but it’s more relaxed as weekends bring in regulars who’ve become friends. By the evening, I’m usually hanging out at the loft or doing something fun and spontaneous with the crew. Sundays are often for relaxing, nursing any hangover, and watching sports—definitely a more laid-back vibe.
