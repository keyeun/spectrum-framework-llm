1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in a new place, feeling the freedom but also the weight of starting over. I spend most of my day figuring out my next steps, possibly looking for work or exploring my new surroundings. I keep to myself, trying not to attract much attention while I work on laying the groundwork for a new life.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by trying to relax and take my mind off the past. I might spend some time outdoors, enjoying nature, which helps me to clear my head. I'm cautious about forming new relationships, but I'm slowly trying to open up to meeting new people or maybe just acquaint myself more with the area.
