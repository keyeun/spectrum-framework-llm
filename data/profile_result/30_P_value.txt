1. Overall Value Summary (Psychotherapistâ€™s Perspective)
This individual prioritizes personal pleasure and the well-being of those around them highly in their value system, indicating a balanced focus on both self-indulgence and altruism. They exhibit a strong desire for autonomy, making independent choices while navigating social contexts. They also value influence and control, constantly striving to wield power in ways that align with their universalist principles of fairness and equality. Achievement, security, conformity, and tradition are present but secondary, only influencing actions when they align with the major values mentioned. Stimulation is also crucial, with the individual likely seeking novel experiences that enrich their pleasure and personal growth.
