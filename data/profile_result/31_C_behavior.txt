1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting up early, usually around 6:00 AM. I like to start my day with a strong cup of coffee and a quick glance at my schedule. I ensure the kids are up and ready for school, bridging any last-minute parental duties. Then, I head to work at the company, where I'm currently the CEO, tackling meetings and projects head-on.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later than usual, usually around 8:00 AM. I'll savor a leisurely breakfast with my husband and discuss weekend plans. Our weekends often involve family activities, errands, and catching up on any home projects. If we have a weekend without too many plans, I love to unwind with some gardening or a good book in the backyard.
