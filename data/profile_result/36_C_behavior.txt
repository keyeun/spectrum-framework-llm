1. A typical weekday for me starts off by rolling out of bed a little later than planned. I usually grab a quick breakfast, maybe some cereal or a granola bar, and then head to classes at community college. In between classes, I'm either hanging out with friends or catching up on homework. Afternoons can include working on various entrepreneurial projects or part-time jobs, followed by family dinner. Evenings are for relaxing, watching TV, or playing video games. 

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit longer than I can on weekdays. Once I'm up, I usually grab a leisurely breakfast, perhaps some pancakes or eggs. After breakfast, I often spend time working on my latest invention or project, or simply hanging out with friends. Sometimes we play basketball or video games. Saturdays might include a family activity, and Sundays are often reserved for catching up on any homework and chilling around the house.
