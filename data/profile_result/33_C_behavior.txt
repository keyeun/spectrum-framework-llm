1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, usually around 6:30 a.m., to get a bit of quiet time before the rest of the house wakes up. I spend a few minutes stretching or doing a short meditation to set a calm tone for the day. After helping my daughter get ready for school and having breakfast with my husband, I head to work at my firm where I tackle various cases, usually focusing on environmental law and other civil rights issues. My days at the office are packed with meetings, client consultations, and court preparations. Evenings are reserved for family time, dinner together, and occasionally catching up on a TV show with my husband before bed.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little later, followed by preparing a slightly more elaborate breakfast or brunch with my family. We often plan activities that involve the outdoors like hiking or a family bike ride, or sometimes we tackle a fun project at home, like redecorating or gardening. Saturdays are usually our day for cultural outings such as visiting museums or going to the theater. Sundays tend to be more relaxed; we might meet up with friends for lunch, spend some time reading or indulging in our hobbies. I also use some of Sunday to prepare for the upcoming week.
