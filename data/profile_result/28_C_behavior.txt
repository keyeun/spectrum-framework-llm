1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting up early with my husband and our kids. I make a quick breakfast while juggling getting everyone ready for the day. I then head to my job as an art consultant, where my day is filled with meetings, art showings, and helping clients find the perfect pieces for their collections. After work, I pick up the kids and we head home for family dinner and some quality time before the bedtime routine kicks in.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by enjoying a slightly slower morning with my husband and the kids, possibly with pancakes and extended breakfast. We often spend Saturdays doing family activities like visiting the park, a museum, or having playdates. Sometimes I sneak in a little painting or catch up with my friend and the gang at the pub. Sundays are more relaxed, usually involving some meal prep for the week, a bit of housekeeping, and savoring the few quiet moments with a good book or a new episode of our favorite show.
