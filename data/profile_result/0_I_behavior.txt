1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, often preoccupied with my thoughts on expanding my meth manufacturing business or dealing with the immediate threats against me and my family. I spend my day meticulously planning and executing lab work, meeting with my associates, and trying to manage tensions and conflicts that frequently arise from my illegal activities. My evenings are spent attempting to maintain a semblance of normal family life, although often distracted and distant due to the double life I lead.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by trying to spend time with my family to make up for my absences and aloofness during the week, which is frequently interrupted by the demands and emergencies of my business. I often engage in cleanup or setup for the next batch of production, managing logistics or addressing problems with my partners. The constant pressure and conflict from my double life continue to pervade even these days meant for rest.
