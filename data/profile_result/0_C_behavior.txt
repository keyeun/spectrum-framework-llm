1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, usually around 6:30 am, to get ready for work at Caltech where I'm a physicist. Breakfast is often quick, sometimes just cereal or whatever is around, followed by a short commute. My day at the university is filled with teaching, research, and sometimes departmental meetings. Lunch is usually with my friends, where we discuss everything from superhero theories to scientific conundrums. After work, I head home, sometimes stopping for takeout if my wife and I decide to take it easy for dinner. Evenings are spent either hanging out with my friends at my apartment, working on additional research, or relaxing with my wife.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit, maybe till around 8 or 9 am. My wife and I often have a leisurely breakfast together, sometimes experimenting with new recipes or just sticking with pancakes or eggs. The day might include running errands, shopping, or occasionally a trip to the comic book store with my friends. We also enjoy watching movies or playing video games. Evenings could be spent at home or occasionally going out for dinner or to catch a movie. Sundays are generally more relaxed; I might spend some time reading or working on a personal project, and we often have a late lunch with friends or just enjoy some downtime at home.
