1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in my apartment and head straight to the fridge for breakfast, which usually consists of whatever leftovers I can find. After that, I might go for an audition or head to a set if I have a gig that day. Later, I drop by a cafe to grab coffee and catch up with the gang. If there's no work, I might lounge around, watch TV, or hang out with my friend.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by being more relaxed. I sleep in until late morning, then check in on my latest acting auditions or scripts. The rest of the day might involve hanging out with friends, having meals at my friend’s, or playing foosball with my friend. If there’s a party or event, I’m there, making the best of my free time before catching some rest for the week ahead.
