1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting my son ready for school, making breakfast, and preparing my husband for his day. After dropping my son off, I'll spend some time managing our household, running errands, or meeting friends for lunch. In the afternoon, I might focus on personal projects or help out with my husbandâ€™s business. Evenings are for family dinners and sometimes attending social events or school functions.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by enjoying a leisurely morning, perhaps cooking a big Colombian breakfast for the family. We might have plans for outdoor activities like going to the park or having a family outing. Saturday evenings are often for social gatherings with friends or attending parties. Sundays are more about relaxation, attending church, and preparing for the upcoming week, ensuring everything at home is organized.
