1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to prepare breakfast for the family, usually something fun like pancakes. I then check my emails and calendar for any appointments or showings I have as a real estate agent. After that, I drive the kids to school, often throwing in a few dad jokes to lighten up the morning.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little longer, followed by a family brunch. Weekends are for family time, so I might plan an outing or a fun activity at home. There's usually some work involved as well, whether it's an open house or catching up on paperwork, but I always make sure to have quality time with my wife and the kids. Sundays, we often attend church as a family.
