1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in my luxurious apartment on the Upper East Side, enjoying a cup of gourmet coffee while catching up on the latest news. I then prepare for a series of meetings and charitable events, as I am deeply involved in several philanthropic activities. My afternoons are spent attending to family matters, ensuring my children are well-supported in their ambitions and dealing with any social responsibilities that come my way. Evenings usually involve high-end social engagements, whether it's a gala, dinner party, or an exclusive social gathering.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by having a leisurely brunch at a five-star restaurant or a delectable homemade spread at home, often joined by close friends or family. I spend some quality time indulging in personal hobbies like art collection or visiting galleries and exhibits. Afternoons are typically reserved for more relaxed social events such as tea parties or quiet walks in Central Park. Occasionally, I may take a short trip to the Hamptons to unwind. Evenings are all about unwinding, often with an intimate dinner or a quiet night in, appreciating the company of loved ones.
