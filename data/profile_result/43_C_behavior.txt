1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up fairly early to get ready and open up the modeling agency. I usually have a quick breakfast and then spend most of the day handling bookings for my models, attending meetings, and sometimes scouting for new talent. My evenings are typically spent at home with my husband where we cook dinner together or hang out, occasionally meeting up with my friend and the rest of the gang if we're up for it.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by enjoying a slower morning, often sleeping in a bit before having breakfast with my husband. Saturdays are usually for catching up on personal errands or shopping, and Sundays we often host or go to brunch with friends. We like spending our weekends relaxing, watching movies, or planning for any upcoming events or travel.
