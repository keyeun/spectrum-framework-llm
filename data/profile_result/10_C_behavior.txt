1. A typical weekday for me starts off by rising early in my penthouse suite, after a short but satisfying sleep. I have a personal assistant bring up a bespoke breakfast, usually eggs benedict paired with an espresso. Next, I review the stock market and latest business news while getting dressed in my tailor-made suit. I then head to the headquarters of my company to handle various business ventures, meetings, and strategic planning throughout the day. Lunch is often a business affair at a high-end restaurant, followed by more meetings and perhaps a call or two to international partners. Evenings might include a networking event, a visit to one of my clubs, or a private dinner with my wife.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in just a bit longer than usual, which allows me to recover from the tumultuous business week. I usually have brunch with my wife or some other influential acquaintances at an exclusive Manhattan hotspot. My afternoons might be spent reviewing real estate investments, attending a charity gala, or even going for a rare leisure activity like a private yacht trip. Nights are often dedicated to the social scene, hosting a party at one of my clubs or attending high society events with my wife by my side.
