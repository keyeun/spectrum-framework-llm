1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to hit the gym. I love starting my day with some cardio or strength training to keep in shape. After my workout, I head home to shower and make breakfast for myself and my husband. Then, it's off to work, where I spend my day managing the restaurant and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Between coordinating with staff, handling customers, and creating new recipes, my days are hectic but rewarding.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in just a bit longer; I allow myself this little luxury on weekends. Once I'm up, I usually spend the morning tidying up the apartment because a clean home makes me feel calm. Sometimes, my husband and I go out for brunch with our friends; other times, we host them for a meal at our place. The rest of the weekend often involves spending quality time with my husband and the twins, catching up on errands, and, of course, cooking something special.
