1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early in the morning to get ready for my day in the fashion world. After a quick breakfast, I head to work or meetings related to my fashion line. Throughout the day, I'm either sketching new designs, overseeing production, or networking with other industry professionals to grow my brand. Evenings might involve attending fashion events or catching up with friends.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by relaxing and being creative. I usually sleep in a bit and then spend some time working on personal design projects or looking for inspiration around the city. Afternoons might be spent hanging out with friends or family. I also enjoy visiting new boutiques or art galleries to keep my creative juices flowing.
