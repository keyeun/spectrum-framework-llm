1. A typical weekday for me starts off by reluctantly dragging myself out of bed for a quick cereal breakfast before heading to my job in advertising. I spend most of my day at the office, brainstorming and creating slogans. Evenings are usually about hanging out at the coffee house with my friends or enjoying some downtime with my wife at home.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by catching some extra sleep and making a more elaborate breakfast, often experimenting with new recipes. The weekends are more relaxed: spending time with my wife, visiting the coffee house, meeting up with freinds, and occasionally going out for dinner or a movie.
