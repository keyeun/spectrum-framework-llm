1. Overall Value Summary (Psychotherapistâ€™s Perspective)
The character highly values self-direction and universalism, driving their desires for independence and a broader sense of social justice. They also prioritize achievement and benevolence, aiming for personal success while being kind and supportive to others. Although power is somewhat significant, it does not overshadow their other core values. Security, stimulation, conformity, and hedonism impact their choices but do not dominate their actions. Tradition holds minimal importance and rarely influences their decisions or behaviors.

2. Explanation in Everyday Language
This character loves being independent and making their own choices, while deeply caring about fairness and justice for everyone. They strive to be successful in what they do but also go out of their way to help others and be kind. While they do recognize the importance of power, it's not as crucial as their drive for success and doing good. They value being safe, having fun, and fitting in sometimes, but these aspects aren't as central in their daily life. Following traditions or doing things just because they've always been done isn't that important to them. In everyday situations, this person will likely take charge of their decisions, aim high in their goals, be considerate and helpful to those around them, and ensure their actions are fair and just.
