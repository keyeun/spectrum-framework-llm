1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting up early and brewing a cup of coffee. I like to spend some quiet time reading or checking emails before I head to class or work on a film project. It helps me gather my thoughts and plan out my day. The rest of my weekday includes attending my college classes at NYU, particularly focusing on my film and media studies. I also spend time shooting and editing films, meeting with classmates for group projects, and maybe working a part-time job to support myself financially. I always make time in the afternoon to catch up with friends and network within the film industry. My evening usually ends with winding down back at my apartment or a friend's place. I often finalize some editing or review film materials for my next project. I enjoy catching up on the latest films or episodes of ongoing shows for inspiration. Afterward, I might call or text someone close to me before heading to bed.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little later than usual. Once I'm up, I grab brunch with a friend or hit up a local caf√©. I often bring my laptop to work on some creative writing or to sketch out ideas for new film projects. The rest of my weekend includes exploring the city for filming spots or sourcing inspirations. I love visiting art galleries, indie film festivals, or catching up on cultural events. I might also volunteer to help on an indie film set or attend workshops to improve my craft. Weekends are also a great time to relax with friends and take a break from the hustle. My evening usually ends with going to a small gathering or event with friends. Whether it's a low-key movie night or an industry networking event, I make sure to stay connected and inspired. By the end of the night, I unwind by jotting down notes or reflections in my journal before heading to bed.
