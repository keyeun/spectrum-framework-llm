1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, usually to the sound of my quirky alarm clock or a sing-along tune, which I can’t resist. I then make a creative breakfast, playfully themed to match my outfit of the day! After breakfast, I head off to work as a middle school principal, where I spend the day managing school activities, helping kids, and occasionally breaking into song or donning a costume to keep things fun. Evenings vary: I might hang out with my friends, go on a date with my husband, cook a new recipe, or work on one of my DIY projects.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit (though not too late!), followed by a relaxed, homemade brunch where I experiment with pancakes or waffles and all sorts of toppings. I love spending my weekends exploring local flea markets, trying out cooking classes, or planning get-togethers with friends. There’s usually a craft or redecorating project in there somewhere, and at some point, I curl up with a good book or catch up on movies I’ve missed.
