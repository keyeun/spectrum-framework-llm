1. A typical weekday for me starts off by suiting up because, we all know, the clothes make the man. I head to work, completely dominating the corporate scene with my bro by my side. Lunch usually involves strategizing my next big play, both professionally and romantically. Evenings are reserved for hitting the hottest clubs and bars with my friends, scouting for potential legendary nights. And it always ends with one of my spectacular, albeit often short-lived, dates.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by waking up late—usually in an unfamiliar place—after an epic night out. Then, it's brunch time with the gang, where we recount the tales from the night before and plan our next adventure. Weekends are less about work and more about play; it's when I pull out my most outrageous suits and stunts. Whether it's laser tag, a new magic trick, or orchestrating an elaborate event, you can bet it's going to be legen—wait for it—dary!
