1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in my luxurious Upper East Side apartment and getting ready with a carefully curated outfit befitting a day of corporate conquest or society brunching, depending on my schedule. I typically check my planner, confirming appointments and meetings, usually related to my work in the fashion industry or managing Waldorf Designs. My afternoons are often filled with business meetings or shopping for the perfect additions to my wardrobe, followed by an elegant dinner at an upscale restaurant or a charity event.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by enjoying a leisurely breakfast usually involving croissants and coffee, and reading the latest in fashion and society news. I might spend my afternoon shopping on Madison Avenue or visiting a spa for some pampering. Evenings could involve attending a gala, a Broadway show, or hosting a dinner party at home, making sure everything is perfectly arranged and up to the Waldorf standard.
