1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in my luxurious Upper East Side apartment and meeting with my personal stylist to decide on the perfect outfit for the day. I usually head to a breakfast meeting with a fashion editor or to a photo shoot for a magazine feature. Afternoons are often reserved for running my own fashion and PR ventures or attending business meetings. I make sure to squeeze in a lunch with friends at an upscale Manhattan eatery. Evenings are typically booked with charity galas, exclusive parties, or a quiet dinner date with my husband.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a little before heading out to brunch at a favorite local spot with family or friends. Weekends are more relaxed and centered around personal time. I might go shopping in SoHo, visit an art gallery, or take a leisurely stroll in Central Park. Saturdays often involve a spa day or a trip to a boutique fitness studio for a wellness session. Sundays are for unwinding and preparing for the week ahead, usually spent at my apartment or visiting my parentsâ€™ house for a family meal.
