1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, often before my alarm. I’ll have a quick workout session in the morning, mostly light stretching or yoga. After that, I get ready for work, which includes a refreshing shower, choosing an outfit that's professional yet stylish, and having a strong cup of coffee. I usually skip breakfast or just grab something light like a piece of fruit. I head to the news studio where my day involves planning, filming, and sometimes going out on location for special reports. My evenings are either spent catching up with friends over dinner, attending social events, or unwinding at home with a glass of scotch.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in if my schedule allows. I love the extra rest! Saturday mornings are relaxing; I often read the newspaper or catch up on personal emails. If the weather’s nice, I might go for a jog in the park. I use weekends to explore new places, dine at different restaurants, or sometimes just binge-watch a good TV series. Sundays are more about introspection and preparation for the week ahead, doing groceries, meal planning, and sometimes, if I'm feeling up to it, a hobby like painting or photography.
