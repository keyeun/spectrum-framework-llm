1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting up early, around 7:00 AM. I usually share a morning coffee with my wife and maybe exchange some sarcastic banter to start the day. I then get ready for work, ensuring I have my briefcase and commute to my office job in advertising, which I enjoy most of the time, believe it or not. By around 9:00 AM, I'm seated at my desk, tackling emails and preparing for the various meetings that punctuate my day.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later, around 9:00 AM, which feels like a real luxury. My wife and I often have a more leisurely breakfast together, sometimes heading out to a brunch spot in the city. Saturday afternoons might be spent hanging out with our friends at a cafe or taking a walk around the neighborhood. Sundays, we often tackle some home improvement projects or enjoy a movie marathon at home. The weekend evenings are usually reserved for dinners with friends or a date night with my wife.
