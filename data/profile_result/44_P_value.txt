1. Overall Value Summary (Psychotherapistâ€™s Perspective)
This character highly values Self-Direction, emphasizing independence and freedom in their life choices. With Universalism and Benevolence being central, they focus on understanding, protecting the welfare of all people, and caring for others. Hedonism also drives them, seeking pleasure and enjoyment in their experiences. While Achievement is important and influences their actions, Power and Security are only of some importance, and Tradition and Conformity hold even less sway over their decisions.

2. Explanation in Everyday Language
This person's everyday behavior is characterized by an approach that values freedom and autonomy, meaning they'll often seek new experiences and chart their own path. Their strong focus on global welfare and kindness means they are likely compassionate and driven to help others, often placing others' needs above their own. Seeking enjoyment and pleasure, they will gravitate towards activities that bring them happiness and excitement. Achievement remains a priority, pushing them to set goals and work hard, but traditional norms and conforming to societal expectations are less influential in their choices. This blend makes for someone who is independent, altruistic, fun-loving, and driven, often engaging in activities that benefit both themselves and those around them.
