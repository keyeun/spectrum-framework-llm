1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to tend to my twins. Mornings are pretty hectic with feeding, changing, and soothing the babies. After they're settled, I usually grab a quick cup of coffee and try to sneak in some work for the lifestyle brand where I’m working. It’s a balancing act of making calls, answering emails, and attending virtual meetings, all while handling motherhood duties.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in, if the babies allow it! When they wake up, I team up with my husband to take care of the kids and get the household in order. We often plan a fun family activity, whether it’s a playdate, visiting my parents, or simply spending quality time at home. I love weekends because I get to focus more on family time without the pressures of work.
