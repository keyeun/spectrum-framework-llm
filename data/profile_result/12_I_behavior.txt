1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up fairly early, around 6:30 AM, making sure to get in a little reading time while sipping on my coffee. I'll then check on any news related to my company, although I'm trying to let my daughter handle more of the day-to-day. I spend most of my mornings either at the office overseeing things or taking some calls from home. Afternoons are more relaxed; maybe a nap, some TV, or fussing over my dog.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by waking up a bit later than usual, followed by reading the newspaper in my pajamas while enjoying a heartier breakfast made by my wife. Saturdays are often reserved for family time, either hosting a barbecue, attending one of the kids' sports games, or dealing with a family crisis. Sundays are more about unwinding and preparing for the week ahead, maybe a round of golf if the weatherâ€™s nice.
