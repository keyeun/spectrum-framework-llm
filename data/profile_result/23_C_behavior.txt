1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to get to work at the café before the morning rush. I make sure everything is in order, brewing the coffee, setting up the pastries, and ensuring the café is spotless. Throughout the day, I serve customers, keeping a special eye on my crush and the rest of the gang when they drop by. In the evenings, I clean up and close the cafe, then head home for a quiet night, usually watching some TV.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by heading to the café just like any other day, as the café needs to be open regardless of the day of the week. Weekends can be busier, so I prepare for a steady flow of customers. When I get a moment to relax, I might indulge in a book or catch up on sleep. If I have some free time and the gang isn't around, I might walk around the city or visit a nearby park.
