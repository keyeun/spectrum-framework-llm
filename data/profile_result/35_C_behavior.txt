1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early to enjoy a quiet breakfast with my mom. I savor a cup of freshly brewed espresso and a carefully prepared breakfast, usually something continental. After breakfast, I head off to attend my college classes, immersing myself in the world of literature, theatre, and film studies. In between classes, I like to spend my time at a local café, writing poetry or working on my latest play. Evenings typically involve rehearsals for any theatre productions I’m a part of, or sometimes I unwind at home with a glass of red wine and a classic foreign film.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit longer and enjoying a leisurely brunch with my family. We often have heartwarming and animated conversations about our week. Midday, I might meet up with friends for a laid-back afternoon at a local art gallery or a poetry reading event. Late afternoons are dedicated to practicing my culinary skills, trying out new recipes. Evenings are usually spent either at a bookshop café writing my thoughts or hosting dinner parties for my close friends, where we discuss literature, cinema, and life.
