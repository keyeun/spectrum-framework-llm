1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up in my quirky, artsy apartment and maybe doing some morning stretches or meditation to get the vibes of the day just right. Then, I’ll head down to a coffee shop – either to catch up with my friends or to strum some songs on my guitar. If I'm not performing, I'm probably working as a masseuse or doing something creative, like writing new songs or maybe even art. The evenings could be anything from hanging out with friends at someone's place to performing live at a local spot.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by enjoying a lazy morning, often with a cup of herbal tea and some good music. Weekends are for exploring – maybe checking out a flea market, visiting an art gallery or taking a walk in the park. Catching up with friends for brunch or a movie is always on the agenda. Sometimes I engage in charity or activist work, and I love ending the day by either having friends over for dinner or going to a small gig to perform or watch live music, just letting the day unfold naturally in my true style.
