1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early in my apartment in New York City, typically by 7 a.m. I grab a quick breakfast—usually cereal or some toast with coffee—before heading to work. I’m a professor of architecture at Columbia University, so after breakfast, I either prepare my lecture notes for the day or review any class projects that need grading. I head off to the university around 8 a.m., taking the subway. My day is filled with teaching classes, meeting with students during office hours, and perhaps working on my personal architectural designs or projects.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later compared to weekdays, usually until 9 a.m. I take my time with breakfast, maybe having pancakes or going out for brunch with friends if we have plans. My weekends are more relaxed, often starting with catching up on some reading—anything from architectural magazines to classic literature. By mid-morning, I might head to the park for a walk or meet up with friends for various activities. If there’s no particular plan, I work on personal projects or spend time exploring new parts of the city.
