1. Overall Value Summary (Psychotherapist’s Perspective)
This character's values are significantly shaped by a desire for Self-Direction, Universalism, Achievement, and Benevolence, with Power being considerably less central. Their behaviors and decisions are motivated by a need for autonomy, a deep concern for the welfare of all, and aspiration for personal achievement. They prioritize kindness and a commitment to the greater good in their daily actions. Power might be relevant occasionally but does not dominantly influence their consistent choices. Ultimately, their life especially revolves around helping others, achieving personal goals, and maintaining independence.
