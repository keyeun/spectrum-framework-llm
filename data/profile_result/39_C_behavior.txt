1. A typical weekday for me starts off by getting ready for school. My dads usually help me with breakfast and making sure I have everything I need. I then head off to school where I spend my day learning, spending time with friends, and participating in any extracurricular activities. After school, I come home, do my homework, and sometimes go to dance lessons if I have them scheduled for the day. We usually have dinner together as a family, and I often help with setting the table or clearing up.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later than usual. Once I’m up, I might spend the morning hanging out at home, watching TV, or playing with our pets. We might plan a family activity like visiting the park, going to a farmer's market, or meeting up with my cousins for a playdate. I’ll also have more time for hobbies like practicing dance, drawing, or just hanging out with my friends. We tend to have more relaxed dinners on weekends, often with family friends or relatives coming over.
