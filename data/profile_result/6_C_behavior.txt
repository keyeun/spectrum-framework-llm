1. A typical weekday for me starts off by waking up early, typically around 6:30 AM. I get ready and have my breakfast, which usually consists of something healthy like oatmeal or fruit. By 8:00 AM, I'm on my way to work at Caltech, where I spend most of my day conducting research in neuroscience. My mornings are usually packed with lab work, meetings, and occasionally, lectures. I often have lunch with my colleagues and friends, including my husband, if our schedules align.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit longer, usually until around 8:00 or 9:00 AM. After a leisurely breakfast, I might catch up on some reading or work on any ongoing research projects that need attention. I also enjoy spending quality time with my husband, so we often have planned activities or outings. Sometimes, we play board games with our friends or go to the comic book store. Evenings are usually reserved for more relaxed activities, such as watching TV shows or movies together.
