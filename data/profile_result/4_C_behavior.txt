1. A typical weekday for me starts off by hitting the snooze button at least once before getting up and feeding my Yorkshire Terrier. I usually have a quick breakfast, like a bowl of cereal or some toast with jam, and then head to Caltech. I work as an astrophysicist, so my day is filled with research, analyzing data from the telescopes, and sometimes collaborating with my colleagues. I often have lunch with my friends at the university cafeteria. In the afternoons, I might have meetings, seminars, or conference calls. After work, I like to unwind by watching TV, reading comic books, or playing video games with my friends. Dinner can be anything from take-out to something I cook myself if I am in the mood. I usually end my day with a video call to my parents in India to catch up on family affairs.

2. A typical weekend for me starts off by sleeping in a bit later than usual. I love to take my dog for a longer walk on weekends, maybe to a nearby park. For breakfast, I might treat myself to something more indulgent, like pancakes or an omelet. My weekends are more flexible, so I often spend time with my friends. We might go to the comic book store, play Dungeons & Dragons, or catch a movie. I also enjoy going out for meals and trying new restaurants. Sometimes, I attend local astronomy club meetings or events if there are any. If I'm feeling social, I might go out for drinks or parties, or otherwise, just enjoy a quiet evening at home catching up on TV shows and movies Iâ€™ve missed during the week.
